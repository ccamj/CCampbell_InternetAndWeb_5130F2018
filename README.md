Internet and Web 5130 Fall 2018 (Tu 5:30 - 8:15)

Course Project: Social Network for Companies

###### 10/28/2018
I've added user account login/signup forms and styles. Most of this is in PHP. In the next few days I want to try NodeJS because most recommendations point to node as the preferred client side language and it's known to be faster. For the coming weeks my plan is to accomplish the following:

- Add an 'Organization Creation' page for a user to create their own company/organization page.

- Create a group hierarchy that is visible by all members of the group. (A HR employee can look up an employee in accounting).

- Add group pages for project sharing/collaboration

- Add messaging between users

I intend to work roughly in this order, but likely add some things inbetween.

I had been playing around with my 3 previous ideas, looking at what I would be working on. I felt they were not unique/presentable enough to make a meaningful project. I came up with a new idea while I was at work which is a social media platform suited for companies. This would basically be a group with a hiearchy of individual employee profiles to represent their positions in their company. The last thing I think people need is another social media platform, but I think this would be more of an office organization tool. A service like this could make it easier to communicate with co-workers, and in larger companies you may not always know how to get in contact with everyone. This could help schedule meetings, post announcments, and manage who is working on a project, and what exactly they are currently working on.

I'm not aware of any prexisting platform designed for companies similar to this. LinkedIn and Facebook often have company pages, but those really aren't designed to help employess communicate. I could see this being useful in my own work, so I think it could be meaningful to others aswell.

I've had a few ideas for a project related to Internet and Web:
1) An easy to use API for communicating with websites. Functions to scrape a webpage and parse html elements, fill in and submit forms, and similar things. I'm more familiar with this sort of project, so I am more confident with the idea, but there are many pre-existing options by Apache, Curl, and OpenSSL.

2) A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection/mitigation tool. There is a lot of unimplemented research papers in this area and I find the idea interesting, although I know nothing about the subject so it would be far more challenging. There are some products for this like Cloudflare, but DDoS protection still doesn't seem to be widely available, affordable, and accurate enough.

3) Packet sniffing/analyzing tool. I know a bit about this already. Wireshark is one of the more popular products in this area, but it has no functionality to sniff packets for other machines on your network that aren't coming from/going to your machine. There is a process called ARP Spoofing which allows you to intercept packets that are meant to be delivered to another machine.

I'd love to go with option 2 (DDoS mitigation), I find it to be a more meaningful project to work on, and I think it can relate well to the course. I will be taking a closer look at what will be involved in accomplishing that. If it doesn't seem achievable by December I will probably go with option 3 or 1.
