Course Project

I've had a few ideas for a project related to Internet and Web:
1) An easy to use API for communicating with websites. Functions to scrape a webpage and parse html elements, fill in and submit forms, and similar things. I'm more familiar with this sort of project, so I am more confident with the idea, but there are many pre-existing options by Apache, Curl, and OpenSSL.

2) A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection/mitigation tool. There is a lot of unimplemented research papers in this area and I find the idea interesting, although I know nothing about the subject so it would be far more challenging. There are some products for this like Cloudflare, but DDoS protection still doesn't seem to be widely available, affordable, and accurate enough.

3) Packet sniffing/analyzing tool. I know a bit about this already. Wireshark is one of the more popular products in this area, but it has no functionality to sniff packets for other machines on your network that aren't coming from/going to your machine. There is a process called ARP Spoofing which allows you to intercept packets that are meant to be delivered to another machine.

I'd love to go with option 2 (DDoS mitigation), I find it to be a more meaningful project to work on, and I think it can relate well to the course. I will be taking a closer look at what will be involved in accomplishing that. If it doesn't seem achievable by December I will probably go with option 3 or 1.
